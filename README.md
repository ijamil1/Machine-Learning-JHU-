# Machine-Learning-JHU-
Machine Learning class at Johns Hopkins 

The notebook in this repository contains code for the final project. My group and I worked on a credit card fraud detection task.
Some topics we learned more about from this project include resampling and dealing with imbalanced datasets. We implemented a variety of models including neural networks and autoencoders
